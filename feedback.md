## Boyan's feedback

Hi Kai! Great tutorial, I've used NMDS and ANOSIM once before, but it is great to learn more.

The tutorial follows a clear structure and explains things in an accessible way.

Here are my main thoughts.

1\. Title/branding of the tutorial: The title of the tutorial is not incorrect, but I feel like it may be a bit misleading. When I hear about "Multivariate data analysis" I am thinking about, for example, how to construct linear models with multiple explanatory variables, which is not what this tutorial is about. Also, I think in some places in the tutorial you use "multivariate stats" in a way which is a bit too general. This might just be my biases though.

2\. As there is already a tutorial on Ordination, which includes PCA, PCoA, and NMDS (https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/ordination/), you might want to consider how to make your tutorial a bit more distinct. The inclusion of ANOSIM is definitely a great idea, and your tutorial shows how to make nicer NMDS plots using ggplot2. Maybe there are other things that can be included that will make the tutorial more similar in length to other CC tutorials as well as make it more unique.

3\. You use "data" as a singular/uncountable throughout the tutorial: while personally this doesn't bother me at all, CC tutorials (usually?) follow the scientific convention of treating "data" as a plural.

4\. This tutorial only has two variables (though it has a lot more species): this is not an issue as it is a good, simple way to demonstrate the methods, but maybe adding an example with more variables would be a good way to demonstrate how useful NMDS is, and to expand the tutorial.

5\. Other ideas on more things you can include:

\- PERMANOVA is generally considered a more robust alternative to ANOSIM.

\- SIMPER which tests which variables account for most of the variations between groups.
